      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a student with the UT of Austin Coding Bootcamp.</p>
      <h1>I'm From El Paso, TX.</h1>
      <p>I moved to Austin when I was a kid with my family. El paso is the home of Chicos tacos. There's constantly some kind of fesitival you can find going on there. If you're a nature lover you will enjoy the beautiful mountains sorrunding the dessert land.</p>
      <h1>My hobbies include watching movies and working out.</h1>
      <p>I love scary movies and action movies the most. I go to the gym no less than 3 times a week. Other than those two things i'm pretty boring.</p>
      <h1>What is my Dream Job?</h1>
      <p>I just want something I can enjoy doing and make a living wage off of. OH! and have weekends off.</p>
      <h1>I live in Austin, Tx.</h1>
      <p>The live music capital of the world. We have bats, music, lakes and voodoo doughnuts. What more could a person want?</p>
      <h1>why I want to be a web developer.</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because I feel I have the patience to do it, and do it well. I feel like being a web developer opens so many doors in life. </p>
